"""Per-user ``ws_user`` websocket transport for Smartbox.

One connection serves every device of the account. The wire protocol was
reverse-engineered from the vendor web apps and verified live against
api-lhz (api-notes.md, "Transports — socket_io vs ws_user"); the key
facts this module implements:

* plain WebSocket, JSON frames — no socket.io/engineio layer; the URL is
  ``wss://<host>:443/api/v2/ws_user?token=<enc>&user_id=<id>`` with
  ``user_id`` taken from the access token's JWT ``userId`` claim;
* the client sends exactly one message type, ``{"event": "all_data"}``,
  on open and again 1 s-debounced on every server
  ``{"event": "should_sync"}``;
* the server replies ``all_data`` (full snapshot whose ``devData`` maps
  1:1 onto the ``socket_io`` dev_data payload) and pushes
  ``{"event": "update", "devid": …, "data": {"path", "body"}}`` frames;
* sockets are cut by the server exactly at the token's 4 h expiry with
  close code 1006 (abnormal), so a fresh token per connect is
  load-bearing;
* data silence of many minutes is normal (liveness belongs to the
  server-side proxy PINGs plus the client heartbeat below) — never
  treat data cadence as a failure signal.
